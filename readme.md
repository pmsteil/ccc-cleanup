# Standardized Version of the Catechism of the Catholic Church

This repository contains a standardized version of the Catechism of the Catholic Church (CCC) in a standardized text format.

The CCC is a book containing the official teachings of the Catholic Church.

It is divided into 4 parts, 2865 paragraphs, and 2865 footnotes.

The CCC is available in many languages, but this repository only contains the English version.

The file 'ccc-raw.txt' was the original file which was not standardized in terms of formatting of footnotes, CCC paragraphs, Bible references etc.

The file 'ccc.md' contains the text of the CCC in a markdown format, but the markdown formatting is not yet complete.

This is only a very early alpha version.

I intend to produce a markdown version of the CCC and I intend to test this with an LLM to make sure it can correctly read all
the paragraphs and footnotes and Scripture references.
